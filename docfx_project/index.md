# Linie
Linie is a mathematics library for graphics software that is (very) loosely based on [glm](https://github.com/) with an ideomatic .NET API. The main goal is to provide a foundation that can be easily integrated to bootstrap your graphics related software. Linie is **not** a general purpose linear algebra library.

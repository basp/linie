# Ray Tracing in One Weekend
This is a pretty straightforward port of the ray tracer described in [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley.

The main goal of this project was to battle test `Linie` and see if it could help. It did. You can now ray trace in a day (or a few hours even).

The code contains the example scene from refraction and the final scene of the book.

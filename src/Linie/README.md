# Linie
Linie is a mathematics library that is very loosely based on [glm](https://github.com/) with an
idiomatic .NET API. It is focussed on graphics in one to three dimensions. The
main goal is to provide a foundation that can be easily integrated to your
graphics related projects.

Linie is **not** a general purpose linear algebra library.

## Features
* Linie is 100% .NET, written in C# and has no dependencies.
* It is tiny and can easily be included as source.
* Geared towards beginners and educational purposes.
